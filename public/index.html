      <h3>Checking out WebComponents</h3>
      The banner at the top of this page is a simple WebComponent. I built it
      with DOM APIs alone to get a better understanding of the spec. I'm going
      to share some of what I learned, including pain points, and rounding out
      with good stuff.

      <br /><br />
      <h4>Web Components 101</h4>
      WebComponents are actually the combination of several different Web
      platform technologies (custom elements, shadow DOM, ESM, and
      templates/slots) aimed at enabling greater code reuse with native browser
      APIs.
      <br /><br />Here's some of the big ideas behind the WebComponent spec:
      <ul>
        <li>
          developers can create <b>custom html elements</b> that can be reused
          like regular tags
        </li>
        <li>
          these elements can ship with their own styling through a 'shadow dom',
          an encapsulated sub tree that serves as the root of the element
        </li>
        <li>
          complex, customizable components can be created by combining custom
          elements with &lt;template/&gt; and &lt;slot/&gt;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Pain points</h4>
      One thing I learned from this project is that I don't think I'd ever build
      production WebComponents with DOM APIs alone. Your options for describing
      the internal structure of your component are to 1) use the cumbersome
      imperative DOM creation APIs or 2) use innerHtml.
      <br /><br />
      In defense of the spec, I don't think anyone is recommending these
      approaches. There are a number of libraries (bordering on frameworks) that
      make building WebComponent as breezy as authoring apps in React.
      <br /><br />
      Another problem is the Flash of unstyle Content that seems tricky to avoid
      -- when your WebComponent is loading asynchronously (possibly from a CDN),
      templated content may appear unstyled before flashing into place when the
      component has mounted. One option to mitigate this is to use some styling
      on your host page like this:
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
        <code >
  /* snippet from this page's styles */

  ap-banner:not(:defined) {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  
  ap-banner:defined {
    opacity: 1;
  }
        </code>   
      </pre>
      </div>
      This approach, using the :defined pseudoselector, seems to work pretty
      well. Obviously it would be nice if the content did need to load
      asynchronously, but it's definitely preferable to the unstyled flash. I
      suspect there are better ways to accomplish this, however to me, it's mark
      against the spec to require this kind of workaround out of the box.
      <br /><br />
      <h4>Good stuff</h4>
      Now that I <i>have</i> painstakingly authored this web component, it has
      been pretty easy to drop it in <i>anywhere</i>. For instance, I placed it
      on top of my 'flood the board' game
      <a href="https://alexprinsen.com/rain.html" target="_blank">rain</a> to
      describe the tech in use on that project. All I had to do was publish this
      web component to NPM, and include a simple script tag to pull in the code
      from a CDN:

      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
        <code >
  &lt;script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/ap-banner@0.0.6/index.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </code>   
      </pre>
      </div>
      With that, I can drop the &lt;ap-banner /&gt; tag anywhere. That is pretty
      slick.
      <br /><br />
      Now that I have a better understanding of the spec, I think my next
      project with WebComponents will use one of the library solutions on to
      give them a fair shot. At this point, I remain skeptical about the ideas
      of building an entire production web application with web components.
      <br /><br />
      However, given their immense potential for reuse and their lack of
      dependency on a runtime framework, I think there are definitely niches
      where this could prove useful. For instance: organizations looking to
      maintain a consistent look and feel throughout their web products, I think
      WebComponents have a strong potential as the base of a Design System
      backed Component Library.
