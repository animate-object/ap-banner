      <h3>Checking out WebComponents</h3>
      The banner at the top of this page is a simple WebComponent. I built it
      with DOM APIs alone to get a better understanding of the spec. I'm going
      to share some of what I learned, including pain points, and rounding out
      with the good stuff. You can check out the source code for my WebComponent
      <a href="https://github.com/animate-object/ap-banner" target="_blank"
        >here</a
      >.

      <br /><br />
      <h4>Web Components 101</h4>
      WebComponents are actually the combination of several different Web
      platform technologies (custom elements, shadow DOM, ESM, and
      templates/slots) aimed at enabling greater code reuse with native browser
      APIs.
      <br /><br />Here are some of the big ideas behind the WebComponent spec:
      <ul>
        <li>
          developers can create <b>custom html elements</b> that can be reused
          like regular tags
        </li>
        <li>
          elements can ship with their own styling through a 'shadow dom', an
          encapsulated subtree that serves as the root of the element
        </li>
        <li>
          complex, customizable components can be created by combining custom
          elements with &lt;template /&gt; and &lt;slot /&gt;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Pain points</h4>
      One thing I learned from this project is that I don't think I'd ever build
      production WebComponents with DOM APIs alone. Your options for describing
      the internal structure of your component are to 1) use the cumbersome
      imperative DOM creation APIs or 2) use innerHtml.
      <br /><br />
      In defense of the spec, I don't think anyone is recommending these
      approaches. There are a number of libraries (bordering on frameworks) that
      make building WebComponent as breezy as authoring apps in React.
      <br /><br />
      Another problem is the Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) that seems tricky
      to avoid -- when your WebComponent is loading asynchronously (possibly
      from a CDN), templated content may appear unstyled before flashing into
      place when the component has mounted. One option to mitigate this is to
      use some styling on your host page like this:
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
        <code >
  /* snippet from this page's styles */

  ap-banner:not(:defined) {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  
  ap-banner:defined {
    opacity: 1;
  }
        </code>   
      </pre>
      </div>
      This approach, using the :defined pseudoselector, seems to work pretty
      well. Obviously it would be nice if the content did not need to load
      asynchronously, but it's definitely preferable to the unstyled flash. I
      think it's not ideal if WebComponents, with all the promise of
      encapsulation and reuse, require changes to the host page. Perhaps there
      are better ways to accomplish this, however to me, it's a mark against the
      spec to require this kind of workaround out of the box.
      <br /><br />
      <h4>Good stuff</h4>
      Now that I <i>have</i> painstakingly authored this web component, it has
      been pretty easy to drop it in <i>anywhere</i>. For instance, I placed it
      on top of my 'flood the board' game
      <a href="https://alexprinsen.com/rain.html" target="_blank">rain</a> to
      describe the tech in use on that project. All I had to do was publish this
      web component to NPM, and include a simple script tag to pull in the code
      from a CDN:

      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
        <code >
  &lt;script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/ap-banner@0.0.6/index.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </code>   
      </pre>
      </div>
      With that, I can drop the &lt;ap-banner /&gt; tag anywhere. That is pretty
      slick.
      <br /><br />
      Now that I have a better understanding of the spec, I think my next
      project with WebComponents will use one of the library solutions in order
      to give them a fair shot.

      <br /><br />At this point, I remain skeptical about the ideas of building
      an entire production web application with WebComponents. However, given
      their immense potential for reuse and their lack of dependency on a
      runtime framework, I think there are definitely niches where this could
      prove useful. As an example, for organizations looking to maintain a
      consistent look and feel throughout their web products, I think
      WebComponents have a strong potential as the base of a design-system
      backed component library.
