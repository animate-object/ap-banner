        >The WebComponent standard enables developers to create their own
        reusable markup that can be consumed like regular html elements.
        Combined with HTML5 templates, you can even create web components that
        can render custom children (like this content!). There are some neat
        libraries that make it easier to author web components with best
        practices however I built this one with DOM apis to get a better feel
        for what is going on under the hood.</span
